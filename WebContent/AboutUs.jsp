<font size="4">Carpool is a safer and convenient way to move around a city. I am a location based system designed to share rides with people heading your way. I am designed for efficient way to travel to your workplace or anywhere around Mumbai. Sharing your ride with people in your area adds many benefits to your pockets. In this era, car-pooling is a new thing which needs an initiative to develop. In simple few steps you can connect with people travelling on your way.Carpooling is a bit different than a car rental. In carpooling, the car is owned by one person, and they offer rides to others. Other co-travelers pay towards the ride cost, including fuel, road tolls, etc.</strong>

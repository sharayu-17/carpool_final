<h3>Members are advised to exercise their own judgement in offering or booking available seats and making the journey. Carpool recommends the following tips so that the member can get a sense of comfort to decide whether or not to undertake the journey.</h3>
<br>
<b>Before you book</b><br>
Verify : Look for verifications and feedback on a user's profile. Check out if the user has a social network link and see if you have any common friends. Look for mutual friends on ride post pages and member profiles.
<br>Chat: Send a message and start a conversation. Use the Carpool messenger to track a conversation about your trip. The email addresses associated with your Carpool accounts are kept private.
<br>Plan ahead: Make sure you both know exactly where you are headed. Have a complete understanding and agreement on which route would be taken for the trip and where the pick-up and drop points are going to be.
<br>
<b>Before the journey</b>
<br>Pick a place : Agree to meet at a public place that is normally busy.
<br>Verify Vehicle and Driver details: Check out whether the details of the vehicle model and the registration number are matching with those mentioned in the journey details. Do also check the authenticity of the Drivers licence and its validity.
<br>Check out other passengers: Verify the other co-passengers of the driver and see if it confirms with the details mentioned. If there are other Carpools, compare them with the details on the Journey details page.
<br>
If you have the slightest of hesitation or discomfort, do not undertake the journey.

<br>
<b>After you perform the Journey</b>
<br>Leave feedback : Traveling together through Carpool means you are part of a community. You can help make that community better by leaving feedback for the people you ride with. We strongly encourage users to leave feedback for each other after a journey.
In case you have decided to not perform the journey after meeting the member offering the seat, you are requested send the feedback citing reasons. This will help us in improving the quality of our offering.
